To install FXTracker:

Make this simple edit in index.php (where Settings.php is):

Find:
---------------
		'buddy' => array('Subs-Members.php', 'BuddyListToggle'),
---------------
Replace with:
---------------
		'buddy' => array('Subs-Members.php', 'BuddyListToggle'),
		'bugtracker' => array('Bugtracker.php', 'BugTrackerMain'),
---------------

Then upload the Sources and Themes site to your ==LOCAL SERVER==. That's right, DO NOT USE THIS ON LIVE SITES. Crap doesn't work yet so if you do use it it's your fault if you get errors. There you have it.

NOTES:
- Log in as admin to use the tracker. Permissions don't work yet.
